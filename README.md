# Kenney's UI audio pack

**Kenney's UI audio pack, pre-packaged for use in Godot.**

50 user interface sound effects including buttons, switches and generic clicks.

Sounds were converted from Ogg Vorbis to WAV for lower CPU usage and better
compatibility with Godot, at the cost of slightly larger file size. This is a
lossless conversion which keeps the original sound quality.

See [this page](https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-audio) for the original package.

*Support the original artist to create more free game assets:*
